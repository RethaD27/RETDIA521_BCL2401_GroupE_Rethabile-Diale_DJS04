## Reflections
* One of the main challenges I faced during development was implementing the book preview 
  feature. This required managing dynamic content and ensuring smooth interactions between the 
  user interface.
* The other challenge that I encounterd was to modify the 'BookPreview' component so that each book is displayed in one vertical line, which I did not overcome.
